 • Build very interactive user interfaces with frameworks like React

Data Types:
var //Globally scoped
let //you can reassign values with this data type
const //short for constant which means it cannot be changed or reassigned. Use them when you know that you won't reassign the values

Difference between == and ===
With ==, it matches the values while the === matches the data type

Ternary Operators:
const color = x > 10 ? 'red' : 'blue'
? - this is the ternary operator and it represents then
: - this means else

Arrow Functions Syntax:
(data type) (variable name) = (expression) =>
	(body of the code/operations)
